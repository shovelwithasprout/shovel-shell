# shovel-shell
a "minimal" shell with quickshell as the main bar

## Components
Niri (if using hyprland, you will need to replace the workspaces.qml)
Fuzzel
Quickshell (for the top bar)
MPD (Mpris module can be configured to allow other players, but I personally reserve it for MPD)
Mako

## Install
Installing should be as simple as just installing the dependencies above and then transferring all necessary config files into their respective folders. For example...

Niri's ``config.kdl`` should be put in ~/.config/niri/
You can find any config file directories elsewhere online.
